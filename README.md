#FusionAI: A Voice Assistant for Autodesk Fusion 360
Use FusionAI to CAD using voice commands!  
Voice assistants are becoming more and more popular in everyday life, I thought that they could be used with CAD as design becomes less and less keyboard-reliant with the advent of new technologies like VR.  
Only a concept and would not be practical for simple commands, but with more complex commands it could be very useful.  
Its convenient location on the Fusion UI's NavToolbar makes it simple to click and say a command
